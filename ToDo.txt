V3 Bugs:
Console error on logout

type store, actions, login and register api calls
tidy up method of styling - check styles and themes are correctly split
replace react-addons-update - think we should use ... somehow (spread operator)- think I've done this? Cant get the fucker to build though...

make app wide loading thing (steal from HouseFood)
