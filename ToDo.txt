To Do:
check all on Add Transactions
next page on View Transactions

UI Improvements: 
You are logged in as - use chips and avatars (same on balance)
progress when adding transaction

Bugs: 
sort out catch when API call fails
add in error handling in general -- My Account (main final problem)
initialisation of ErrorMessage (comes through blank first time hit after refresh for some reason?)

V3
API return better error messages (e.g. user already exists) - rewrite this in .net Core
Make userId field and keep email address separate
Change return from transaction History (let client format data)
move to free SQL
.net core API

Missing Error Messages: 
sign up - EMAILADDRESS already exists
login - Invalid user name or password

Possible improvements:
Offline loading with service worker
Server side rendering for instant load
Add dateAdded to transaction (current date)
