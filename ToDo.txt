To Do:
fix delete user
message hides too quickly on update user!
add 404 page

UI Improvements: 
You are logged in as - use chips and avatars (same on balance)

V3
Progress when adding transaction - think this may be not work due to no response from API?
API return better error messages (e.g. user already exists, change password) - rewrite this in .net Core
Make userId field and keep email address separate
Change return from transaction History (let client format data)
move to free SQL
.net core API

Missing Error Messages: 
sign up - EMAILADDRESS already exists
login - Invalid user name or password

Possible improvements:
Offline loading with service worker
Server side rendering for instant load
Add dateAdded to transaction (current date)
