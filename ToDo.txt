Needs Implementing: 
Balance
History
Details
Payday

Rework:
API return better error messages (e.g. user already exists) - rewrite this in .net Core
Make userId field and keep email address separate
Offline loading with service worker
Server side rendering for instant load
deprecate old repo server
Convert to .tsx

Bugs: 
nav - need to change to Payday and History to icons or something neat
theme - can't see imputs very well
