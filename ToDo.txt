Bugs:
PUT and DELETE via cors externally 
menu icon should close menu (clicking anywhere else also closes!) -- Mobile Only bug - maybe just wait for MUI v1?

UI Improvements: 
bootstrap - make responsive html

V3
Progress when adding transaction - think this may be not work due to no response from API?
Need response from edit user - to pickup new user details
API return better error messages (e.g. user already exists, change password) - rewrite this in .net Core
Make userId field and keep email address separate
Change return from transaction History (let client format data)
move to free SQL
.net core API
Add dateAdded to transaction (current date) 
Upgrade message (e.g. for Patch notes and website maintenence screen)
purge store when logout?
Confirm password for Register!
set max length on fields to match API

Missing Error Messages: 
sign up - EMAILADDRESS already exists
login - Invalid user name or password
change password - confirm doesn't match
internal server error when deleting user with transactions? 

Possible improvements:
Offline loading with service worker
Server side rendering for instant load
