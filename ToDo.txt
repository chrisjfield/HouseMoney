Needs Implementing: 
Balance
ViewTransactions
Details
Payday

Rework:
API return better error messages (e.g. user already exists) - rewrite this in .net Core
Make userId field and keep email address separate
Offline loading with service worker
Server side rendering for instant load
deprecate old repo server
Convert to .tsx

Bugs: 
nav - need to change to Payday and ViewTransactions to icons or something neat
theme - can't see imputs very well
sort out catch when API call fails
add in error handling in general
