Rework:
nav bar into side panel on desktop - look at pulling in react-nav-bar
API return better error messages (e.g. user already exists)
Make userId field and keep email address separate
Material Design for UI - look into material-ui https://github.com/callemall/material-ui o.e.  https://hackernoon.com/the-coolest-react-ui-frameworks-for-your-new-react-app-ad699fffd651 
Offline loading with service worker
Server side rendering for flicker
share the load click bug (does not un hover)
deprecate old repo server

Bugs: 

Clicking on words is the only way to nav 
    - not the actual buttons 
    - need to change to icons or something nicer
