bootstrap - make responsive html

General Improvements:
Build sets correct app config

Possible improvements:
Offline loading with service worker
Server side rendering for instant load
convert to typescript


V3 Bugs:
Console error on logout

type store
tidy up method of styling - check styles and themes are correctly split
replace react-addons-update - think we should use ... somehow (spread operator)
